# How To play:

***
*The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. You play on a three 
by 
three game board. The first player is known as X and the second is O. 
Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either 
opponent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. X always goes 
first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is 
called a cat game.
